## Preview







## Motivation

From the course "creating a chrome app course using vanilla Javascript", I have learned how to make a simple login form, a clock, a to-do list and a weather badge using an event listener and API. 
I want to be able to create this chrome app by myself without watching the course. Moreover, I want to try and explore new skills and ideas.



## Roadmap

- [x]  Create an app by using HTML/CSS/Javascript
- [ ]  Create an app by using React
- [ ]  Make the app responsive
- [ ]  



## Features

- [x]  a clock
- [x]  Weather badge (with an icon)
- [ ]  To do list 
- [ ]  Memo
- [ ]  Light/dark mode toggle
